    <h1>Lab Report 1 - Artemis, and build Github Page</h1>
    <p>The objective of this lab was to provide an introduction to programming the Sparkfun Artemis, a powerful microcontroller board that is widely used in the field of robotics. The lab consisted of setting up the Arduino IDE and running example code to test basic functionality. This report will detail the four examples that were completed during the lab, including Blink, Serial, Analog Read, and Microphone Output.</p>
    
    <h2>Example 1: Blink It Up</h2>

    <p>The first example involved testing the LED on the Artemis board by blinking it using the "Blink" example from the Arduino IDE. The LED_BUILTIN pin in the code was mapped to the correct pin on the Artemis. A 1-second on and 1-second off pattern was used to confirm the basic functionality of the LED.</p>
    
    <h2>Example 2: Serial</h2>

    <p>The second example involved running the Artemis Serial example code to test the serial port. The baud rate was set to 115200, which is a common rate used in many serial communication applications. The serial monitor was used to confirm that the text typed in was echoed back, indicating that serial communication was functioning properly. This example demonstrated how to set up basic input and output functionality over a serial port.</p>
    
    <h2>Example 3: Analog Read</h2>

    <p>The third example involved using the Artemis Analog Read example code to read the onboard temperature sensor. The temperature reading began at approximately 31,800 and increased to over 32,000 when the sensor was exposed to the heat release vent of a laptop, confirming the functioning of the sensor and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This example demonstrated how to read analog values from sensors and use them in your program.</p>
    
    <h2>Example 4: Microphone</h2>

    <p>The fourth and final example involved testing the onboard microphone. The Microphone Output example code was used to print out the loudest frequency after performing a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The highest frequency ranged from 0 to about 200 due to ambient noise, but when a beep was played, the frequency consistently hit 1007. This example demonstrated how to use more advanced signal processing techniques to analyze data from sensors.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, this lab provided an excellent introduction to programming the Sparkfun Artemis. By completing the four examples, we gained familiarity with basic functionality such as serial communication, analog readings, and microphone output. These skills will be useful in future labs and projects as we continue to develop our knowledge of robotics and programming.
        </p>
    <p>Furthermore, as a part of this lab, we also learned how to build a Github Page to document our progress and showcase our work. This will be an important tool for us to share our projects and collaborate with other researchers and hobbyists in the field. By following the instructions provided on the lab website, we were able to set up a basic Github Page for our work and begin to develop our online presence as robotics and programming enthusiasts.</p>
