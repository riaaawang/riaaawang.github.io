                            <p>The objective of this lab was to provide an introduction to programming the Sparkfun Artemis, a powerful microcontroller board that is widely used in the field of robotics. The lab consisted of setting up the Arduino IDE and running example code to test basic functionality. This report will detail the four examples that were completed during the lab, including Blink, Serial, Analog Read, and Microphone Output.</p>

                            <p>The first example involved testing the LED on the Artemis board by blinking it using the "Blink" example from the Arduino IDE. The LED_BUILTIN pin in the code was mapped to the correct pin on the Artemis. A 1-second on and 1-second off pattern was used to confirm the basic functionality of the LED.</p>

                            <p>The second example involved running the Artemis Serial example code to test the serial port. The baud rate was set to 115200, which is a common rate used in many serial communication applications. The serial monitor was used to confirm that the text typed in was echoed back (shows in video), indicating that serial communication was functioning properly. This example demonstrated how to set up basic input and output functionality over a serial port.</p>

                            <p>The third example involved using the Artemis Analog Read example code to read the onboard temperature sensor. The temperature reading began at approximately 31,800 and increased to over 32,000 when the sensor was exposed to the heat release vent of a laptop, confirming the functioning of the sensor and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This example demonstrated how to read analog values from sensors and use them in your program.</p>

                            <p>As part of the lab exercise, I utilized the Example1_MicrophoneOutput code under the PDM of Arduino Example to test the onboard microphone of the Sparkfun Artemis board. The code was designed to print out the loudest frequency after performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the audio signal captured by the microphone.</p>
                            <p>During testing, I decided to extend the functionality of the code by incorporating a visual indicator that would turn on and off based on the frequency of the audio signal detected by the microphone. Specifically, I added code to the printLoudest function that would light up the blue LED on the board when an A note (which ideally has a frequency of around 440hz) was played over the speaker. The intention was to use the LED as a simple visual cue to help distinguish different audio signals and frequencies.</p>
                            <p>However, during testing, I discovered that the board recognized the frequency of the A note I played as 434 hz instead of the expected 440hz. This deviation in frequency could be attributed to factors such as the performance of the microphone and the FFT algorithm used in the code.</p>
                            <p>To account for this deviation, I modified the condition in the code that lights up the blue LED to frequencies under 434hz, instead of the expected 440hz. Upon testing, I found that the modification worked as expected and the LED lit up when I played notes in the appropriate frequency range, and turned off otherwise.</p>

                            <p>In conclusion, this lab provided an excellent introduction to programming the Sparkfun Artemis. By completing the four examples, we gained familiarity with basic functionality such as serial communication, analog readings, and microphone output. These skills will be useful in future labs and projects as we continue to develop our knowledge of robotics and programming.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, as a part of this lab, we also learned how to build a Github Page to document our progress and showcase our work. This will be an important tool for us to share our projects and collaborate with other researchers and hobbyists in the field. I learnt to solve a series of problems of Github page website during this lab, even through my website does not work perfectly yet, but I am still working on it. By following the instructions provided on the lab website, we were able to set up a basic Github Page for our work and begin to develop our online presence as robotics and programming enthusiasts. And hopefully, my website will be better soon.</p>

                            <p>The use of wireless communication technologies is becoming increasingly prevalent in modern electronics, and Bluetooth is one of the most widely used wireless communication protocols. In this lab exercise, we will explore the fundamentals of Bluetooth communication using the Artemis board, an open-source microcontroller platform that is compatible with Arduino. Bluetooth communication is particularly useful for applications that require wireless control or data transmission, such as remote sensing and actuation, wearable devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.</p>

                            <p>To prepare for the lab exercise, we will need to perform several setup tasks to ensure that we can communicate with the Artemis board over Bluetooth. These tasks include:</p>
                            <p>1. Installing a Python virtual environment: We will use a Python virtual environment to isolate our Python packages and ensure that we have the necessary dependencies installed. This will help to prevent conflicts with other Python packages that may be installed on our computer.</p>
                            <p>2. Activating the virtual environment: Once the virtual environment is installed, we will need to activate it to ensure that we are using the correct Python interpreter and packages.</p>
                            <p>3. Installing necessary packages and Setup Informations: We will need to install several Python packages to communicate with the Artemis board over Bluetooth. Then find out the UUID and artemis address for my device.</p>
                            <p>4. Downloading and extracting the codebase: We will need to download and extract the codebase for the lab exercise, which includes both Arduino .ino files and Python scripts.</p>

                            <p>By completing these setup tasks, we will be ready to explore Bluetooth communication with the Artemis board and perform the lab exercises. Connecting the Artemis to the computer, and make sure they can communicate (as shown on figures above).</p>

                            <p>The ble_robot directory contains two subdirectories, ble_arduino and ble_python, which are essential components for setting up Bluetooth communication between the Artemis board and a host computer. The ble_arduino folder includes the .ino file and c header files, which must be uploaded to the Artemis board for establishing the Bluetooth connection. The ble_python folder contains several files, including a demo Jupyter Notebook, a .yaml file that assigns unique UUIDs for the Bluetooth connections, and cmd_types.py, which is a Python class that handles all the commands.</p>
                            <p>To establish a Bluetooth connection, the UUIDs in the .yaml file on the computer side must match the UUIDs in the .ino file on the Arduino side. This is crucial for the BLE protocol to identify and pair the Bluetooth connection. By correctly matching the UUIDs, the Artemis board and the host computer can establish a secure and reliable Bluetooth communication channel. The Jupyter Notebook in the ble_python folder provides an easy-to-use interface for sending and receiving data over the Bluetooth connection, which allows users to control the Artemis board and perform various tasks remotely.

                                To enable the ECHO command, it is necessary to add it to the Command Types in the Artemis code and the cmd_types.py file. Additionally, a case statement must be added to the Artemis code to send a characteristic string containing the word "Echo." In the provided image, the ECHO command is transmitted to the Artemis, and the message is received from the Artemis board as shown. This allows us to confirm that data is being transmitted correctly between the host computer and the Artemis board.</p>

                            <p> In order to process the string data received from the Artemis board, we will need to design a new function that will be able to parse the data and extract the relevant information.

                            <p>The Artemis board is equipped with a total of 384KB of RAM, which is equivalent to 384,000 bytes. To determine how much data can be transmitted without exceeding this memory limit, we need to consider the data size and transmission rate. In this case, each data point consists of 16 bits or 2 bytes, and the transmission rate is 150 HZ.</p>
                            <p>Based on this information, we can calculate that in 5 minutes, which is equivalent to (560) seconds, we can transmit a total of (560)/(1/150) * 2 = 90,000 bytes of data. To transmit the maximum amount of data allowed by the memory limit of 384,000 bytes, we need to divide the memory limit by the data size and transmission rate to get the total number of transmission cycles. In this case, 384,000 / 90,000 = 4.267, which means that we can transmit 4.267 cycles of data in 5 minutes.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, the total time required to transmit 384,000 bytes of data without exceeding the memory limit is 4.267 cycles multiplied by 5 minutes per cycle, which is equal to 1280 seconds. This means that we can safely transmit 16-bit data at a rate of 150 HZ for a duration of 1280 seconds without running out of memory on the Artemis board.</p>
