## Lab 1

Introduction:

The objective of this lab was to gain familiarity with programming the Sparkfun Artemis, a microcontroller board that can be used for a variety of robotics projects. To accomplish this, we set up the Arduino IDE, a popular programming environment for microcontrollers, and ran example code to test basic functionality. The Artemis has a wide range of features, so the examples we completed focused on a few key areas, including digital output, serial communication, analog readings, and audio input.

Example 1: Blink It Up

The first example involved testing the LED on the Artemis board by blinking it using the "Blink" example from the Arduino IDE. This example is a classic test for microcontrollers and is often used to verify that the board is functioning correctly. By mapping the LED_BUILTIN pin in the code to the correct pin on the Artemis, we were able to confirm that the board was capable of digital output. We used a 1-second on and 1-second off pattern to provide a clear visual indication that the LED was turning on and off as expected.

Example 2: Serial

The second example involved running the Artemis Serial example code to test the serial port. Serial communication is a fundamental tool for microcontroller programming, as it allows the board to communicate with a computer or other devices. In this example, we set the baud rate to 115200, a common speed for serial communication. We then used the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to confirm that the text we typed in was echoed back, indicating that the serial communication was functioning properly. This example demonstrated the basics of serial communication and provided a foundation for more complex projects that might require communication between multiple devices.

Example 3: Analog Read

The third example involved using the Artemis Analog Read example code to read the onboard temperature sensor. The Artemis has a built-in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that allows it to read analog signals, such as temperature sensors, with a high degree of accuracy. In this example, we used the ADC to read the temperature sensor and display the result in the Arduino IDE. We observed that the temperature reading began at approximately 31,800 and increased to over 32,000 when the sensor was exposed to the heat release vent of a laptop, demonstrating the functioning of the sensor and the ADC. This example showed how the Artemis can be used to read analog signals and provided a foundation for more complex sensor-based projects.

Example 4: Microphone

The fourth and final example involved testing the onboard microphone. The Artemis has an onboard audio input that can be used to capture sound or perform audio processing tasks. In this example, we used the Microphone Output example code to print out the loudest frequency after performing a fast Fourier transform (FFT). This technique is often used in audio processing to identify the dominant frequency components of a signal. We observed that the highest frequency ranged from 0 to about 200 due to ambient noise, but when a beep was played, the frequency consistently hit 1007. This example demonstrated the basic capabilities of the Artemis for audio processing and provided a foundation for more complex audio-based projects.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, this lab provided a useful introduction to programming the Sparkfun Artemis. By completing the four examples, we gained familiarity with key aspects of microcontroller programming, including digital output, serial communication, analog readings, and audio input. These skills will be useful in future labs as we continue to develop our knowledge of robotics and programming. The Artemis is a powerful platform with many features, and this lab provided a solid foundation for further exploration and experimentation.
